    <p>
        I really cant get enough of this food even though we always eat eat this, it still my favorite dish, i think its engraved with my ancestry? hahaha<br>
        but kidding aside, i really like this food every since i was young, whenever i ask my mom or grandma what we will be having for dinner <br>
        and they said its adobo, i was so happy i really looked to it. It tastes comforting which reminds me when i was young that even til now<br>
        i still had the sense of it.

    <h3 class="daniel">Daniel Padilla</h3>


    <p>I dont have a specific favorite artist but whenever i think about someone whose<br> an artist the first person that comes to my mind is Daniel Padilla.<br>
        He's one of the most controversial yet successful person rightnow because of his looks<br> and recent issues yet i still find his acting skills appaling
        so i thinks its<br> one of the reasons why i chose him to for these specific task</p>
