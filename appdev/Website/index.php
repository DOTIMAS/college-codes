    <h2>My Personal Life</h2>
    <p>
        I dont Feel too comfortable telling other people my personal so i make it most of the time a vague story<br> I have 4 siblings and i am the oldest one.<br> 
        our father left us when i think i was 9 years old but he continue to support us for a few months until he totally left us<br> the burden of having 4 children has been placed on my mother
        <br> and thats how we became unfortunate for a few more years until my mom decided that she wants to become OFW<br> she left us and placed us in a care of our grandmother and after that we turned out good
        <br>As of today my mom has still outside our Country and all of us are still studying<br> we all know the sacrifices of our mom and grandma so thats why we continue to fight in order for us to retire our mother
        <br> And that is why i am doing my best to continously learn and have a good grades.<br> Since i am the breadwinner of my family after my mom i ensure that i always did my best.

    <h3>Elementary Years</h3>
    <p>
        Its been a long time but my memories of my elementary years are still fresh in my mind. Since i was young it's my very nature that i am<br>
        playful, even though i cant buy anything i still dont see it as a bad way. I am struggling with tools and equipments yet i am still not<br>
        bothered by it that much. The only that comes to my mind in my elementary years is how i can play despite of classes. I really thought <br>
        it is funny because i see the studies and lessons for every subject as a hindrance for me to play with. Yet i still do good in classes,<br>
        it is engraved in my soul that i must always do my very best for me to make my family proud. In these years i cn still balance the time<br>
        of playing and studying but what really makes me remember these years is the school, the friends that i built, the classes that takes too<br>
        long to finish, the times where i went overboard with my playfulness that leads to me being sanctioned. I can still vaguely remember it <br>
        like it was happened yesterday.

    <h3>High School Years</h3>
    <p>
        In terms of having too many memories my high school has completely filled it up. I can still remember the places, the sections that ive<br>
        been with, the people that i make friends with, the terror teachers, and the strict guard. These school years has become one of the main<br>
        reasons of who i am today, it creates me, shelters me and helped me understand what i am and what i want to become. Whenever i think about<br>
        my high school years i cant help but laugh and my heart aches at the same time. I was really happy because ive had too many friends that <br>
        i bonded with yet it kinda hurts knowing that those friends will never comeback since my path will not corrolate with them yet i am still<br>
        happy for all of us because i know that no matter what path weve chosen i know that what we really shared when we are still in high school<br>
        will be remembered. So instead of being too sad about it i take it as part of fate that no matter what we do it just happens and we cant <br>
        control it so we just need to accept it.

    <h3>College Years so far</h3>
    <p>
        So far my college years has become so-so, i still remember the time that i enrolled at St. Bernadette institution, i was scared and happy <br>
        at the same time knowing full to well that this path will pave my path for a successful life. Luckily, i easily create a friends since i <br>
        have classmate that i am affiliated with in my high school years even though were not that close but we eventually bonded with since we need<br>
        to help out each other. After that every falls into pieces, i studied hard even though mostly the classes are online and it makes me sleepy<br>
        but i knew that i have to give my best. After few weeks we started to have a face to face meetings and that is when i meet my new classmtes,<br>
        professors that is totally a new environment from me. I start to struggle from going to school because i stil havent adjust since my school <br>
        in elementary and high school are both near my house but i still prefer to do face to face since i can learn more. So far my college life <br>
        has been pretty tight i have many unsubmitted activities that i need to pass addition to my own personal responsibilities as a son, grandson,<br>
        brother and being a part of catholic organization but i still believe that everything will be alright as long as i do my best and to always<br>
        remember what i am today and focusing more on my life and continously improving my skills.
